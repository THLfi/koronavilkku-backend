# How to contribute

We welcome contributions from the public.

## Issues

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for reports and queries.

## Pull requests

Our team will review the pull requests and contributors will get credit. You can see all contributors in AUTHORS.md.

## Commit message styleguide

We follow [The seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### TL;DR

- Title line max 50 characters
- Single empty line between title and detailed description when description is needed
- Explain what and why vs. how
- Use the imperative mood in the title line
  - :heavy_check_mark: Refactor subsystem X for readability
  - :heavy_check_mark: Update getting started documentation
  - :heavy_check_mark: Remove deprecated methods
  - :heavy_check_mark: Release version 1.0.0
  - :x: Fixed bug with Y
  - :x: Changing behavior of X
  - :x: More fixes for broken stuff
- Attach issue tracker references at bottom after single empty line `Resolves: #123` or `See also: #456, #789`

## Code Style
Like all matters of taste, code style comes down to individual preferences. 
Within a single project however, it's best to stick with a uniform style.
If you need more detail, refer to "how it's done elsewhere in the codebase" as the no.1 guide.

### Java
- **You should** prefer self-documenting code to comments
  - When the code is not evident enough though, you should comment
- **Never** use nulls
  - Use Optional instead to mark values that may be missing
  - Nulls from outside APIs should be wrapped in Optional "at the border"
- **You should** strive to "make illegal states unrepresentable"
  - Validate inputs in constructor and throw an exception if the data is not good
- **Always** implement request fails as exceptions
  - These are handled in a single place in ApiErrorHandler
- **Always** pass SQL parameters as named params; don't concatenate them into the SQL String
- **Always** read ResultSet contents with column names, not indices
- **You shouldn't** move JDBC parameter-map keys into constants, as that just messes with IDE code assistance and moves it farther from the use-place
- **You should** favor pure functions and immutable structures
- **Always** use constructor injection and final fields for Spring DI
- **You should** use Java 8 date/time API for times
  - GAEN API also mixes UTC interval numbers and using them as-is is also fine

### SQL
- **Always** write SQL directly, no ORMs
- **Never** use the default schema
- **Always** use schema-name as qualifier in table names
- **Always** name tables and columns with snake_case
- **Never** uppercase keywords
  - Rely on your IDE to highlight SQL code, just like any other language
- **You may** write short SQLs in String variables so that they reside where they're used
- **You may** write longer SQLs in separate SQL files and load them as cached resources
- **Always** write migrations in separate .sql files, using Flyway notation for naming
- **You should** favor timestamptz for timestamps
  - GAEN API also mixes UTC interval numbers and using them as-is is also fine
