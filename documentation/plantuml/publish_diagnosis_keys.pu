Keys older than 14 days and in future will be filtered;
:**Verify publish token**

Creates call to publish-token api;
:**Adjust risk buckets**;
note right
  - There is predefined array of day limits for every bucket: 14, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, -3.
  - Day value which is compared towards the array is days between symptomsOnSet and encounter day (the TEK date)
  - Negative value means the encounter has been before the symptoms
  - Value for SymptomsOnSet has been set by a health care professional when creating the publish token
  - Single bucket will be chosen if day value is greater than value in bucket and less than value on the left hand
  - E.g. if value is 11 then bucket with index 1 will be chosen (14 > 11 > 10)
  - On later stage this index value will be used to get value from transmission_risk_scores array defined in configuration
